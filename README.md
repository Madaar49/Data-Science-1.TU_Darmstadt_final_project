# CCPP_AT.Pred
This project aims at predicting the Ambient Temperature (AP) of a Combined cycle power plant CCCP using Machine Learning

Societal and Economic benefits-->
Analysis of the ambient temperature of a CCCP is essential in effeciciency of a Power plant.

Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset contains 9568 data points collected from a Combined Cycle Power Plant over 6 years (2006-2011), when the power plant was set to work with full load. Features consist of hourly average ambient variables Temperature (AT), Ambient Pressure (AP), Relative Humidity (RH) and Exhaust Vacuum (V) to predict the net hourly electrical energy output (PE) of the plant.

##Problem statement
The ambient temperature of a CCCP is essential in regulating a power plant working at full load. This is required to prevent disasters and save energy.
